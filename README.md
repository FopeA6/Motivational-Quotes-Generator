# Lap 1 Debugging Assignment

Welcome to your first debugging assignment!
This repo is riddled with bugs and we need your help to fix it up.
Please make sure that you read the instructions before starting.


## Code of Conduct
- Do not ask your classmates (verbally or through any other communication method) for help.
- Do not copy/paste any code from someone else or from any online resource.


## Tasks
You are going to debug and complete a Random Quotes generator. When you are finished with the app, it should look something like this:

### API
- Install the node modules and run your api server.
- Add a route to get all quotes - check your answer in the browser
- Add a route to display a random quote
- Refactor the /quotes/:index route: Add some logic to handle indices that are outside the quotes array range. You should get the following result:

### Frontend
- Edit title and button using CSS and HTML so that it looks like the one in the gif (don't worry about exact colour or font size). Feel free to use external fonts.
- Change the background image and add image credits in the bottom right-hand corner of the page.
- Clean CSS file (ie. if there are repeated or inherited properties and values that are not needed, delete them)
- Debug code in the app.js and script.js so that a random quote is shown every time the button is clicked.
